## Project objective:
A Commercial Bank intends to develop an application scorecard for their Retail mortgage portfolio. To that end, a dataset including a sample of accepted applications received during the period 2009-2014 was gathered.
It is now required to decide whether the data presents sufficient quality to develop the model. The candidate is required to make a thorough examination of the data and come up with a set of comments and suggestions based on the results observed. 

Additionally, it has been suggested by the Bank's management that the most important variable for credit risk is Loan to Value (LTV). Estimate the relationship of this variable with the default.
